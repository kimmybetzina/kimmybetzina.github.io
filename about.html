            <h3>about me</h3>
        
                <p>My name is Kimberly Betzina, I'm a 21 year old creative and Graphic Designer originally from Puyallup Washington. I am currently attending school at Eastern Washington University where I'm persuing a BA in Visual Communication Design and a Minor in Art. I have a knack for hand lettering, illustrating and interior decorating. I also find myself particularly skilled at logo designs, typography and making designs that are effective and aesthetically pleasing.<br><br>
I am currently working as the Graphic Designer for Eastern Washington University's Housing and Residential Life. I also am a director of the VCD program's club, where we are currently working on branding the VCD program and planning events for the students. I love to be involved with my school, program and peers to learn as much as possible while I'm still in school.
